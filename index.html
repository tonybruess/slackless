    <h1>Slackless</h1>
  </header>

  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>
    An easy way to remind yourself to stop slacking off.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    Because I am easily distracted by Slack.
  </p>

  <h2>How?</h2>
  <pre>$ curl -s https://tonybruess.github.io/slackless/slackless.sh | bash</pre>
  <p>
    This patches <code>Slack.app</code> to load
    <a href="https://tonybruess.github.io/slackless/slackless.js">slackless.js</a>, a simple
    user script that makes it easy to hide the Slack UI.
  </p>

  <!--<p>
    If you'd prefer, you can patch Slack to load whatever user script you'd
    like. Instead of executing <code>slackless.sh</code>, download it then simply pass
    the URL of the script as an&nbsp;argument:
  </p>
  <pre>$ bash slackless.sh https://someotherdomain.com/some-other-script.js</pre>
  <p>
    <b>Caveats:</b> the script <b>must</b> be served over HTTPS, with
    a CA-signed certificate (otherwise the underlying <code>WebView</code>
    will not deign to load it).
  </p>-->

  <h2>No, But How?</h2>
  <p>
    <code>Slack.app</code> is a <code>WebView</code> that loads
    the Slack web application, so we just patch it to run some Javascript in
    the context of the view.
  <p>
    That script then loads additional styles, adds elements to the page, binds keyboard
    shortcuts, and so on.  It also ensures that the Developer Tools menu is always
    available.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Of course, you don't <b>need</b> to patch the app if you
    don't want to; instead you can just open the Developer Tools (by
    running Slack with the <code>--dev</code> command-line option)
    and enter the above code in the Console, everytime you start Slack.
    But that's no fun!
